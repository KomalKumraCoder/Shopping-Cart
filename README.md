Javascript Project along with Normalisation
We have learnt about Session creation And Local Storage Data Usage .
It is an simple web application that has two dashboards:
1.Admin Dashboard: Admin has authority to login , see the orders , delete the products and add the Products
2.User Dashboard:User has authority to login , add to cart , delete from cart and inspect a particular product , change quantity of product.
In this all the data is stored in Local Storage in JSON format.
